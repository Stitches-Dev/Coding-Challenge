# Challenge Description

In this coding challenge, the task revolves around optimizing the performance of a specific endpoint within an existing codebase. Participants are expected to identify and rectify bugs present in certain endpoints, addressing potential issues that might affect the overall functionality of the application. Additionally, a key focus lies on completing the implementation of a designated endpoint. This multifaceted challenge not only tests the ability to enhance the efficiency of an existing code snippet but also requires a keen eye for debugging and the skill to seamlessly integrate a new endpoint into the existing system. Participants will have the opportunity to showcase their problem-solving skills and code proficiency through these diverse tasks.

Before diving into the coding aspect of this challenge, participants are encouraged to formulate a strategic plan outlining their approach to optimizing performance, fixing bugs, and completing the designated endpoint. Effective planning, including a thorough understanding of the existing codebase and a step-by-step breakdown of the problem-solving process, will be crucial for success. As an integral part of the challenge, participants are required to submit a comprehensive report file alongside their code submission. This report should meticulously detail the methodologies employed to address each problem, providing valuable insights into the participant's problem-solving rationale and coding decisions. Emphasizing the significance of thoughtful planning and transparent documentation, this challenge aims to evaluate not only coding proficiency but also the ability to strategize and communicate solutions effectively.
